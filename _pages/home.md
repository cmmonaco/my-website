Welcome to my website! My name is Chris and I'm a Ph.D. student in the Molecular and Systems Pharmacology program at Emory University in Atlanta, Ga. Prior to starting grad school, I worked to develop new molecular assays and custom laboratory equipment at the US CDC: combining my scientific and engineering acumen to expand the capabilities of CDC scientists across the agency. I have also spent several years in K-12 education where I introduced new insights and technologies into classrooms to enhance the success of 21st-century learners. I have a BS in Electrical Engineering and a MS in Bioinformatics, both from Georgia Tech, with research experience that ranges from inorganic materials synthesis to high-throughput genomic data analysis.

When not in the lab, I can be found growing gourmet mushrooms, gardening, or spending time with my partner and tiny dog.
