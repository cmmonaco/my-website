This display case, located in [Drew Charter School's](https://drewcharterschool.org){:target='_blank'}, Elementary Academy, was built as a modern replacement to an old, ugly platflorm. The goal was to provide a display area for the derby car while keeping with the industrial aesthetic in the rest of the entryway. The case is contructed of 3/4" baltic birch plywood and features a curved, back-lit perforated pattern on either side.

This was one of my most challenging builds and the first time curving wood panels, but I'm very happy with how it turned out!
