Magnetic tube racks from commercial lab suppliers can costs hundreds of dollars. But if you have a 3D printer you can make your very own for a fraction of that price! These racks are designed to support two sides of six 1.5-2.0 mL microcentrifuge tubes. They use long, rectangular magnets set lower on the tubes than most commercially available racks allowing for good separation even with very low volume samples. In addition, these racks are designed to slot together to allow for expansion when more than 12 samples need to be processed.

Two designs are available. The _Two Part_ design features a removable top so that samples can be vortexed all at the same time without removing each tube from the rack. The _One Part_ design is a single piece. These racks are designed to accept a 5/8" x 1/4" x 0.1" neodymium magnet. I use ones available from [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/5848K78/).
