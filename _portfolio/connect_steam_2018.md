At Drew Charter School, we had the idea that all parts of the school should be inspirational to our students. This includes the hallways, where we envisioned a children's museum-like atmosphere with interactive elements. One such element is this custom built "Connect STEAM"; an over-sized take on the popular Connect-4 game. Made from CNC-cut plywood panels, the game measurses about 5 feet tall and 8 feet wide. Rather than just two different color tokens, this game features five different color tokens corresponding to each letter in S-T-E-A-M. Players are encouraged to either spell out STEAM, match colors, or make up their own rules.
