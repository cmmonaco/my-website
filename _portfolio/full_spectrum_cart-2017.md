At [Drew Charter School](https://drewcharterschool.org){:target='_blank'}, we encouraged all teachers to utilize the digital fabrication tools in our makerspace. To make some tools more accessible, we tried to make them mobile and so laser cutter carts were born. This cart is specifically designed to house a Full Spectrum laser cutter along with exhaust filter, water resevoir, and computer. It is made from 3/4" sande plywood with a slot-together design. It features a pull-out keyboard tray, small accessory drawer, and cabinet that holds the cooling water resevoir along with plenty of space for material storage.

A 3D model of all the parts of the body are availble following the link in the resources section. Parts were cut out on a CNC router.
